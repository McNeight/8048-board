# 8048 board

This is the circuit design for a board using the 8048 MCU, initially intended to be a clock but can be used for other purposes. It can drive multiplexed 7 segment LEDs or a serial interface display using the TM1637 chip. The timer reference can be the onboard crystal, a DS128(8)7 clock chip, or mains.
